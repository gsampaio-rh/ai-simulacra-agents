# AI Simulacra Agents

**Autonomous agents with real AI cognition** - watch them think, remember, reflect, and plan their days using breakthrough LLM-powered minds. No cloud dependencies, runs entirely locally.

## ‚ú® What Makes This Special

Unlike traditional rule-based simulations, our agents use **real LLM reasoning**:

```
‚ùå Traditional: if mood < 5: goto("social_area")
‚úÖ Our Agents: "I'm feeling down today because I haven't had much 
               social interaction. As a cafe owner, I should visit 
               the community space to connect with people..."
```

**Complete Cognitive Stack**:
- üß† **LLM-Powered Cognition** - Authentic AI reasoning and decision-making
- üíæ **Episodic Memory** - Remember and learn from all experiences
- ‚ú® **Automatic Reflection** - Gain self-awareness and insights
- üéØ **Autonomous Planning** - Create daily goals and schedules
- üé® **Beautiful UI** - Watch every cognitive process in real-time

## üöÄ Quick Start

**1. Install & Setup**
```bash
git clone [repository-url] && cd ai-simulacra-agents
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
ollama pull llama3.2:3b && ollama pull nomic-embed-text
   python scripts/init_db.py
   ```

**2. Watch Agents Think**
```bash
python main.py step
```

You'll see agents use real AI reasoning:
```
üß† Isabella Rodriguez is thinking...
üí≠ "I'm feeling down today and need social connection. 
    As a cafe owner, I should visit the community space..."
‚ú® Decision: move to Community Garden
```

**3. Explore Agent Minds**
```bash
python main.py agent isabella     # See memories, plans, reflections
python main.py plan isabella      # View daily goals and schedule
python main.py reflect isabella   # Trigger self-awareness insights
```
