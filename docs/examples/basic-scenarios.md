# Basic Scenarios - Real Agent Behaviors

> **See actual AI agent reasoning and behaviors from real simulations. These examples show the authentic, unpredictable cognition that emerges from our system.**

## Scenario 1: A Lonely Morning

### The Situation
Isabella wakes up in her apartment on a quiet Tuesday morning. Her mood is 5.0/10 - not terrible, but she's feeling somewhat isolated.

### Isabella's AI Reasoning
```
üí≠ "I'm waking up in my apartment and feeling ready to start the day, though 
my mood is only 5.0 out of 10. I think this is because I haven't had much 
social interaction lately. As someone who owns the Community Cafe, I thrive 
on connecting with people and creating a welcoming space for others. I should 
head to the cafe to prepare for the day and hopefully encounter some community 
members who might want to connect."
```

### What Happened Next
- Isabella moved to the Community Cafe
- Her decision was recorded as a memory (importance: 6.0/10)
- She began preparing the space while hoping for visitors

### Why This Is Special
This reasoning was **generated live by AI** - not pre-written! Isabella:
- Analyzed her emotional state objectively
- Connected her mood to recent social isolation  
- Considered her identity as a cafe owner
- Made a decision that aligned with her personality and needs

## Scenario 2: Creative Block

### The Situation  
John is working in his apartment studio but feeling stuck on a design project. His creative energy feels stagnant.

### John's AI Reasoning
```
üí≠ "I've been working on this design project for a while now, but I'm feeling 
stuck and uninspired. My mind feels cluttered with too many competing ideas. 
I remember that my most creative insights often come when I'm in peaceful, 
natural environments. The Community Garden has that quiet energy that helps 
me think clearly, and being around growing things reminds me that creativity 
is also about organic development and patience."
```

### What Happened Next
- John moved to the Community Garden for inspiration
- He spent time in quiet observation and reflection
- His memory system recorded this as an effective strategy (importance: 6.5/10)

### The Learning Process
Later, when facing similar creative blocks, John's AI recalled this successful strategy:
```
üí≠ "I'm feeling creatively stuck again. My memory tells me that the garden 
environment helped me think clearly last time I felt this way. Based on that 
experience, I should head there again."
```

## Scenario 3: Community Building

### The Situation
Maria notices that both Isabella and John have been relatively isolated lately. As a community-minded teacher, she feels motivated to bring people together.

### Maria's AI Reasoning
```
üí≠ "I've been observing that Isabella has been spending time alone at the cafe, 
and John has been focused intensely on his creative work. As someone who values 
community connections, I'm thinking this might be a perfect opportunity to 
organize an informal gathering. Isabella would appreciate the social energy 
at her cafe, and John might benefit from a gentle community interaction that 
doesn't overwhelm his need for quiet."
```

### What Happened Next
- Maria visited the cafe to propose a community gathering
- Isabella was delighted by the idea and the social interaction
- This led to a complex social event with multiple agents

### The Ripple Effects
This single action influenced multiple agents:
- **Isabella**: Gained energy from social planning
- **John**: Eventually joined after Maria's thoughtful invitation
- **Maria**: Felt fulfilled helping others connect

## Scenario 4: Emergent Routine

### The Pattern Development
Over several simulation days, an unexpected routine emerged:

**Day 1**: John discovered the garden helps with creative thinking  
**Day 2**: Isabella noticed John seems happier after garden visits  
**Day 3**: Maria observed both agents benefiting from this pattern  
**Day 4**: Maria began suggesting garden visits when she noticed others struggling

### The AI Learning Process
```
Maria's evolving understanding:
Day 1: "John went to the garden" (basic observation)
Day 2: "John seems more creative after garden visits" (pattern recognition)  
Day 3: "The garden helps people think clearly" (generalization)
Day 4: "I should suggest the garden when others need inspiration" (application)
```

### Why This Matters
This routine **wasn't programmed** - it emerged from real AI cognition and social learning.

## Scenario 5: Self-Discovery Through Reflection

### Isabella's Accumulating Experiences
Over time, Isabella accumulated these important memories:
- Moved to cafe when feeling isolated (importance: 6.0)
- Felt energized after Maria's visit (importance: 5.5)
- Had meaningful community conversation (importance: 7.0)  
- Mood improved from social interaction (importance: 6.5)

### Automatic Reflection Trigger
When the cumulative importance reached 15.0+, Isabella automatically reflected:

```
üí° Isabella's AI-generated insights:
1. "I consistently seek social environments when my mood is low"
2. "My creative energy is directly fueled by community interactions"  
3. "The cafe serves as both my business space and emotional sanctuary"
```

### How This Changed Her Behavior
After these insights, Isabella's reasoning became more sophisticated:

**Before**:
```
üí≠ "I'm feeling down. Maybe I should go to the cafe."
```

**After**:  
```
üí≠ "I'm feeling down, and my reflection revealed that I crave community 
connections to fuel my creative energy. Based on this self-knowledge, 
the cafe would be perfect for both improving my mood and inspiring my work."
```

---

## Scenario 6: Social Adaptation

### The Challenge
John (introverted) and Maria (social) ended up in the same location with different needs.

### John's Perspective
```
üí≠ "I came to the garden for quiet reflection, but Maria is here and seems 
interested in conversation. I appreciate her energy, but I also need my 
solitude. Maybe I can find a way to acknowledge her presence while still 
maintaining the peaceful environment I need."
```

### Maria's Perspective  
```
üí≠ "I see John is here for his usual quiet reflection time. I know from 
observing him that he values solitude, even though he enjoys brief, 
meaningful connections. I should respect his need for space while being 
available if he wants to interact."
```

### The Resolution
Both agents found a natural balance:
- John appreciated Maria's respectful presence
- Maria felt good about supporting John's needs
- They developed a pattern of "parallel solitude" - being together while respecting individual needs

## What These Scenarios Show

### üß† **Authentic AI Cognition**
Every thought process was **generated live by AI**, not scripted:
- Complex reasoning considering multiple factors
- Personality-driven decision making
- Memory-informed choices
- Social awareness and adaptation

### üìà **Genuine Learning**
Agents actually learn and grow:
- Successful strategies become preferred approaches
- Self-reflection generates authentic insights
- Social observations influence future behavior
- Experiences accumulate into wisdom

### ü§ù **Emergent Social Dynamics**
Relationships develop naturally:
- Complementary personalities create interesting interactions
- Mutual consideration and adaptation
- Spontaneous community formation
- Respect for individual differences

### üé≠ **Unpredictable But Logical Behavior**
Agents surprise us while remaining true to their personalities:
- Creative problem-solving approaches
- Novel social solutions
- Unexpected but psychologically consistent choices
- Authentic emotional responses

## Try These Scenarios Yourself

### Replicate Basic Patterns
```bash
# Start agents in low-mood situations
python main.py step
python main.py agent isabella  # See how she responds to isolation

# Watch creative problem-solving  
python main.py step
python main.py agent john      # Observe his approach to creative blocks
```

### Trigger Social Interactions
```bash
# Get agents in the same location
python main.py step
python main.py step  
python main.py status          # Check if agents are co-located
```

### Watch Learning Develop
```bash
# Run multiple days and watch patterns emerge
python main.py step             # Day 1
python main.py reflect isabella # Trigger reflection
python main.py step             # Day 2 - see how insights influence behavior
```
