# Research Methodology

This document outlines the scientific methodology underlying the AI Simulacra Agents system, providing researchers with the theoretical foundations, validation approaches, and analysis frameworks necessary for academic study.

## 📚 Theoretical Foundations

### Cognitive Architecture Theory

Our system implements a **cognitive architecture** based on established theories from cognitive science and artificial intelligence:

**1. ACT-R Cognitive Architecture** (Anderson, 2007)
- **Declarative Memory**: Episodic memory system stores factual knowledge
- **Procedural Memory**: LLM reasoning patterns serve as procedural knowledge
- **Memory Activation**: Hybrid retrieval with decay and frequency effects

**2. SOAR Architecture** (Laird, 2012)
- **Goal-Oriented Reasoning**: Planning system creates hierarchical goals
- **Problem Solving**: LLM reasoning for novel situation handling
- **Learning**: Reflection system enables experience-based learning

**3. Global Workspace Theory** (Baars, 1988)
- **Consciousness**: LLM reasoning provides global integration
- **Attention**: Memory retrieval focuses on relevant experiences
- **Broadcasting**: Current decisions influence future cognition

### Memory Systems Research

**Episodic Memory Model** (Tulving, 1972):
```
Event Encoding → Storage → Retrieval
     ↓             ↓         ↓
Action/observation  Vector    Semantic + 
+ importance       embeddings temporal +
scoring by LLM     in Chroma  importance
```

**Forgetting Curve Integration** (Ebbinghaus, 1885):
- **Recency Weighting**: `exp(-time_elapsed / decay_constant)`
- **Importance Modulation**: High-importance memories resist decay
- **Retrieval Strengthening**: Accessed memories gain activation

### Reflection and Metacognition

**Metacognitive Framework** (Flavell, 1976):
- **Metacognitive Knowledge**: Agents develop self-understanding through reflection
- **Metacognitive Regulation**: Planning based on self-knowledge
- **Metacognitive Experiences**: Triggered by experience accumulation

**Social Cognitive Theory** (Bandura, 2001):
- **Self-Regulation**: Autonomous planning and goal-setting
- **Self-Reflection**: Automatic insight generation from experience patterns
- **Self-Efficacy**: Agent confidence in achieving planned goals

    coherence_scores = []
    for action in agent_actions:
        personality_alignment = measure_alignment(action, personality_traits)
        coherence_scores.append(personality_alignment)
    return mean(coherence_scores)
```

    # Measure goal achievement rate
    if not planned_goals:
        return 0.0
    achievement_rate = len(achieved_goals) / len(planned_goals)
    return achievement_rate
```

**4. Cognitive Complexity Measure**
```python
def cognitive_complexity(reasoning_texts):
    # Analyze reasoning depth and sophistication
    complexity_scores = []
    for reasoning in reasoning_texts:
        # Measure: sentence complexity, concept integration, 
        # causal reasoning, temporal reasoning
        complexity = analyze_reasoning_complexity(reasoning)

    # Same input should produce same memory importance
    assert memory_system.score_importance(event) == expected_score

def test_retrieval_determinism():
    # Same query should retrieve same memories (given same state)
    memories_1 = retrieval_engine.get_memories(query)
    memories_2 = retrieval_engine.get_memories(query)
    assert memories_1 == memories_2
```

**2. Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**
```python
# Test system robustness to parameter changes
def parameter_sensitivity_test():
    baseline_behavior = run_simulation(default_params)
    for param in critical_parameters:
        modified_params = default_params.copy()
        modified_params[param] *= 1.1  # 10% increase
        modified_behavior = run_simulation(modified_params)
        sensitivity = calculate_behavior_difference(baseline, modified)
        assert sensitivity < acceptable_threshold
```

### External Validity

**1. Cross-LLM Validation**
```python
# Test behavior consistency across different LLM models
models = ["llama3.2:3b", "llama3.2:8b", "mistral:7b"]
behaviors = {}
for model in models:
    behaviors[model] = run_simulation_with_model(model)

# Measure inter-model reliability
reliability_score = calculate_inter_model_consistency(behaviors)
```

**2. Human Comparison Studies**
```python
# Compare agent behavior to human baselines
def human_comparison_study():
    # Present same scenarios to humans and agents
    human_responses = collect_human_responses(scenarios)
    agent_responses = collect_agent_responses(scenarios)
    
    # Measure similarity in decision patterns
    similarity = compare_response_patterns(human_responses, agent_responses)
    return similarity
```

### Construct Validity
