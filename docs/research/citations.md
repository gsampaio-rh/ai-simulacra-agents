### Key Distinctions

**vs. Traditional Rule-Based Agents**:
Our system uses LLM reasoning for decision-making instead of predefined rules, enabling authentic cognitive behavior and emergent personality expression.

**vs. Behavior Trees/State Machines**:
Rather than explicit behavior programming, our agents use natural language reasoning to evaluate situations and make contextually appropriate decisions.

**vs. Reinforcement Learning Agents**:
Instead of reward optimization, our agents use intrinsic motivation through personality-driven goals and self-reflection capabilities.

**vs. Pure LLM Chatbots**:
Our system adds persistent episodic memory, automatic reflection, and autonomous planning to create coherent agent identities that develop over time.
